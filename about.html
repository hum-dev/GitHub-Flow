    <p>A software engineering training focused on SQL, Node.js, React.js, and Express.js would likely cover the following topics:
     <ul>
        <li>SQL: The training would cover the fundamentals of SQL, including data types, basic queries, advanced queries, and database design. Participants would learn how to create, update, and manipulate data in a SQL database.</li>
        <li>Node.js: The training would cover the basics of Node.js, including its event-driven architecture, modules, and the Node.js package manager (npm). Participants would learn how to use Node.js to build server-side applications and how to interact with databases using Node.js.</li>
        <li>React.js: The training would cover the basics of React.js, including its component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and JSX syntax. Participants would learn how to build user interfaces using React.js and how to manage state in a React application.</li>
        <li>Express.js: The training would cover the basics of Express.js, including its middleware architecture, routing, and handling of HTTP requests and responses. Participants would learn how to use Express.js to build RESTful APIs and web applications.</li>   
     </ul>
          
        The training would likely be hands-on and project-based, with participants working on real-world examples and building applications using the technologies covered. The training might also cover best practices for software engineering, including version control, testing, and deployment.
